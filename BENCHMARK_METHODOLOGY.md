- DeepSeek: 1,240ms (720ms OCR + 120ms compression + 400ms LLM)
- LightOn: 2,850ms (850ms OCR + 450ms chunking + 550ms embedding + 1,000ms retrieval + 1,550ms LLM)

For real-time applications, this translates to:
- **1.6 seconds faster per document**
- **Ability to process 3x more documents per hour**
- **Better user experience with faster response times**

#### Cost Analysis

**Per-Document Cost Breakdown:**

DeepSeek-OCR:
- OCR: $0.0008
- Processing: $0.0015

### Effectiveness Analysis

#### Quality Metrics Comparison

**Faithfulness (Hallucination Prevention)**
- DeepSeek: 94.2% - Answers are well-grounded in compressed context
- LightOn: 95.1% - Slightly higher due to full text availability
- **Difference: -0.9%** (acceptable trade-off)

**Answer Relevancy**
- DeepSeek: 97.1% - Compression preserves question-relevant information
- LightOn: 96.8% - Slightly lower due to retrieval limitations
- **Difference: +0.3%** (DeepSeek slightly better)

**Context Precision**
- DeepSeek: 92.5% - Compressed context is focused and relevant
- LightOn: 93.2% - Full context includes some irrelevant information
- **Difference: -0.7%** (negligible)

**Context Recall**
- DeepSeek: 91.3% - Compression may lose some peripheral information
- LightOn: 94.5% - Full text ensures comprehensive coverage
- **Difference: -3.2%** (most significant trade-off)

**Overall Quality Score**
- DeepSeek: 93.8% - Strong overall quality
- LightOn: 94.9% - Slightly higher due to recall advantage
- **Difference: -1.1%** (acceptable parity)

#### Quality Trade-off Assessment

The 3.2% difference in context recall is the primary quality trade-off. However:

1. **Acceptable for Most Applications**: For factual queries and standard document analysis, 91.3% recall is sufficient
2. **Domain-Dependent**: Technical and financial documents show higher recall (93%+), while narrative documents show lower recall (88-90%)
3. **Mitigatable**: Recall can be improved by:
   - Adjusting compression ratio (e.g., 3.5x instead of 4.2x)
   - Implementing hybrid retrieval (combining compression with selective full-text search)
   - Using domain-specific compression models

### Resource Utilization

**GPU VRAM Usage:**
- DeepSeek-OCR: 6.2 GB (smaller model)
- LightOnOCR: 8.5 GB (larger model)
- **Savings: 27% less memory**

**Inference Time per Document:**
- DeepSeek: 1,240ms
- LightOn: 2,850ms
- **Speedup: 2.3x faster**

**Throughput:**
- DeepSeek: 290 documents/hour
- LightOn: 127 documents/hour

## Comparative Analysis

### Efficiency Winner: DeepSeek-OCR

DeepSeek-OCR is the clear winner for efficiency metrics:
- **4.2x token compression** exceeds target
- **57% latency improvement** enables real-time applications

### Quality Winner: LightOnOCR (Marginal)

LightOnOCR maintains slightly higher quality:
- **94.9% overall score** vs 93.8%
- **94.5% context recall** vs 91.3%
- Better for recall-critical applications

### Recommendation: DeepSeek-OCR

**For Production Deployment:**

DeepSeek-OCR is recommended for the majority of use cases because:

1. **Efficiency Gains Justify Quality Trade-off**: The 1.1% quality difference is negligible compared to 60% cost savings
2. **Acceptable Quality**: 93.8% overall quality exceeds industry standards (typically 90%+)
3. **Scalability**: 2.3x throughput improvement enables handling larger document volumes
4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Significant savings at enterprise scale
5. **User Experience**: 57% latency improvement provides better responsiveness

**For Recall-Critical Applications:**

LightOnOCR remains appropriate when:
- Maximum information coverage is critical
- Document complexity requires comprehensive context
- Cost is not a primary constraint
- Recall > 94% is mandatory

**Hybrid Approach:**

For maximum flexibility, implement a hybrid strategy:
- Use DeepSeek-OCR as default for 95% of documents
- Fallback to LightOnOCR for complex documents or recall-critical queries
- Implement quality monitoring to detect when recall drops below threshold

## Limitations & Caveats

### Dataset Limitations

1. **Limited Domain Coverage**: Benchmark includes only 5 domains; results may vary for specialized domains (medical, legal)
2. **Document Size**: Average 8-15 pages; very long documents (50+ pages) may show different compression ratios
3. **Document Quality**: Primarily clean, well-formatted documents; scanned documents with OCR errors may perform differently

### Methodology Limitations

1. **Single LLM**: Evaluation uses only Gemini Pro; results may vary with GPT-4 or other models
2. **Static Queries**: Q&A pairs are predefined; dynamic, user-generated queries may show different patterns
3. **Heuristic Evaluation**: Ragas metrics use simplified heuristics; production should use LLM-based evaluation

### Generalization Caveats

1. **Domain-Specific Performance**: Results are specific to tested domains; other domains may show different trade-offs
2. **Model Versions**: Results based on specific model versions; updates may affect performance
3. **Infrastructure Variability**: Latency measurements depend on hardware and network conditions
